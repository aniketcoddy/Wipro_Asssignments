Write a SELECT query to retrieve all columns from a 'customers' table, and modify it to return only the customer name and email address for customers in a specific city.

SELECT * FROM customers;

To modify this query to return only the customer name and email address for customers in a specific city (let's say the city is 'New York'), the query would be:

SELECT CustomerName, EmailAddress
FROM customers
WHERE City = 'New York';
