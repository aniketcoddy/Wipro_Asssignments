Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they enter '0'. The script should also print whether each number is odd or even.

#!/bin/bash

# Function to check if a number is odd or even
check_odd_even() {
    if [ $(( $1 % 2 )) -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "$1 is even"
    else
        echo "$1 is odd"
    fi
}

# Read numbers from the user
while true; do
    read -p "Enter a number (0 to exit): " number

    # Check if the number is 0, if so, exit the loop
    if [ "$number" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Exiting..."
        break
    fi

    # Check if the number is odd or even
    check_odd_even "$number"
done
