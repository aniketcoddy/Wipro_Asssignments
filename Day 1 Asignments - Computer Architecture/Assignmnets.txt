1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**:
   - The CPU is the primary component of a computer responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
   - It consists of several key components, including the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), Control Unit (CU), Registers, Cache, and buses.

2. **CPU components and functions**:
   - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
   - **Control Unit (CU)**: Coordinates the activities of the CPU, fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and executing them.
   - **Registers**: Small, fast memory locations within the CPU used to store data temporarily.
   - **Cache**: High-speed memory used to store frequently accessed data and instructions, speeding up CPU operations.
   - **Buses**: Communication channels that transfer data between CPU components and other parts of the computer.

3. **How a CPU executes instructions**:
   - The CPU fetches instructions from memory.
   - The control unit decodes the instructions and directs the ALU and other components to execute them.
   - Results are stored back in memory or registers.

4. **CPU performance factors**:
   - Clock speed (measured in GHz): The number of instructions a CPU can execute per second.
   - Instruction set efficiency.
   - Cache size and efficiency.
   - Number of cores and threads.
   - Memory bandwidth.
   - Microarchitecture design.

5. **Microarchitecture design**:
   - Refers to the internal organization of a CPU.
   - Includes decisions about instruction pipelines, cache hierarchy, branch prediction, and more.

6. **Instruction set architectures (ISAs)**:
   - Defines the set of instructions a CPU can execute.
   - Determines the CPU's compatibility with software.

7. **Branch prediction and speculative execution**:
   - Techniques used to improve CPU performance by predicting the outcome of branch instructions (e.g., if-else statements) and executing instructions speculatively.

8. **Parallelism at the instruction level (ILP)**:
   - Exploiting parallelism within a single instruction stream to improve performance.
   - Techniques include pipelining, superscalar execution, and out-of-order execution.

9. **CPU cooling and thermal management**:
   - Necessary to prevent overheating and maintain CPU performance.
   - Methods include heatsinks, fans, liquid cooling, and thermal paste.

10. **The future of CPUs: Quantum computing and beyond**:
   - Quantum computing offers the potential for vastly superior processing power by leveraging quantum mechanics.
   - Other future directions include neuromorphic computing, photonic computing, and advances in traditional CPU architectures.
